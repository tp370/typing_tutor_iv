Hello! Please type: @home #go_now $save-file %test_case &run=true.  
Check the value of x == 5 && y != 10; don't forget the ; at the end.  

Use brackets like (this), [that], and {those} when needed.  
To escape a quote, type: \" or \'. Use \\ for a backslash.  

Punctuation helps: use commas, periods, colons: and semicolons; properly.  
In emails, type something like: user.name+test@example-domain.org.  

Run `make build && ./a.out`; then press Ctrl+C to stop the process.  
Use -> and => for pointers or arrow syntax in C/C++, JavaScript, etc.  

Math symbols: a != b, x >= y, z <= 0. Use ++ or -- carefully.  
Try typing `grep -E '^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$' file.txt > result.log 2>&1`.  

The URL was https://example.com/search?q=typing+symbols&sort=desc.  
Separate tokens with _, use camelCase, or try kebab-case too.  

Use command line flags like -v --help --output=result.txt.  
When using JSON: {"key": "value", "list": [1, 2, 3]} is valid.  

Caution! Don’t confuse ` with ' or " — each has its role.  
End a sentence with a period.  Or a question mark?  Maybe an exclamation!
